# Basic Kubernetes Deployer

A bunch of scripts that automate the custom deployment of Kubernetes in multiple clouds and environments (currently only for GCP) with Terraform, Packer, and Ansible. The project is based on [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) project by Kelsey Hightower.
